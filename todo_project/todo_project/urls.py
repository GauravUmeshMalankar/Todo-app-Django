# What are admin urls in django?
# Admin URLs in Django are special URL patterns that provide access to the Django admin interface.
# They allow site administrators to manage the application's data models through a web-based interface.
# The admin URLs are typically prefixed with 'admin/' and are configured in the project's main urls.py file.
